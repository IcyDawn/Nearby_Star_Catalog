# Nearby_Star_Catalog
This catalog contains 2575 stars within 20 parsecs from the Earth, mainly based on the Gaia Catalog of Nearby Stars (GCNS), with more completed parameters including stellar luminosity, effective temperature, radius, and mass. Following are descriptions for columns in the NSC & Habitable Zone results.
